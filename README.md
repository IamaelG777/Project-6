# Steps

1. **Code name** (if with group)
2. search to your best potential(of course)
3. Sets of three
4. 5, 6, 7, 8 Leafers(yes, there's more than just 4 leaves on clovers)
5. mix and muddle 
6. Preserve the *clover*
7. Frame the *clover*

## How the steps are understood
- Code name: f you are going to look with someone else (in my case, my dad) tell them to look in a different place from you. Also, think of a codeword that you will say if you find one.
I told my dad to say peaches if he found a 4 leaf clover and that I would do the same if I found a 4 leaf clover. Using codewords is a good way to communicate with the person you are looking with.
- Sets of three: A good tactic for finding a four leaf clover is to think about the sets. Each 'normal' clover has a set of three leaves. A four leaf clover has, well, a set of four leaves.
Just think of the sets. Say each set you see in your mind as you pass the clover. If you are lucky, you will come across something that doesn't look like a set of three.
- Mix and Muddle: The number of leaves on a clover isn't the only type of mutant clover there is. There are many, many other mutations that occur with clovers. I heard somewhere about a spade leafed clover. That will be one mutant, but a spade four leafed clover would be two mutations mixed together!

### Save for **possible** Bank $$
You never know if 4 Leaf Clovers will cost a lot of money so find as much as you can and save for the **future**
